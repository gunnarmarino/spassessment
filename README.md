# spassessment
Here it is... It meets all the requirements specified but could definetley be extended in a few areas, mainly to prevent spamming our inboxes with alerts.
<br>
* Clinicians on the boundary are still said to be within the zone
* We alert when an endpoint doesn't respond
* A warning is signaled within 5 minutes when a clinician is out of bounds
* We have a relatively generic polling method

I reallllllllly had to squeeze this in between driving to Arkansas and back for a new passport, packing for a hike in Peru, and settling other affairs before my flight. Because of that I wasn't able to put as much work into it as I'd have liked and I didn't do extensive testing on it (or take the time to write tests), but I tested it enough to confirm the above points work properly.
<br><br>
That being said, I really hope what I've written is sufficient cause I'd love to work here. If not (or if it's even a close call) I'd love to resume our conversation when I'm back in the USA (June 1st) to see if we can work something out
<br><br>
Looking forward to hearing back,
<br>
Gunnar
