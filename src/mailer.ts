//I didn't put much work into this for a lack of time.
/*

    In a larger codebase I'd assume we'd already have a more generic mailer written.
    Then I'd likely write a class which extends that mailer with methods for sending specific alerts like outOfBoundsAlert and noResponseAlert
    I would have throttled the outOfBoundsAlert for each sprinterID (so we wont get alerts for the same sprinterID over and over)
    noResponseAlert should be written differently where we get an alert when an endpoint fails and when it becomes available again.
    noResponseAlert would likely become useful in other cases and the logic could be moved.
